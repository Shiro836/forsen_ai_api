# BAJ AI

## Funny character AI using twitch reward buttons with:
- Control panel that allows you to skip unwanted requests.
- Custom characters with custom personalities and custom voices. (you can create your AI persona)
- Uncensored LLM. (no more "as an AI language model I hate white color")
- Word filter List. You can filter words you don't want to listen or see, both from the chatter requested and from the AI responding.
- Forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen.

## Plans:
- [x] Security features (added control panel sharing and fixed filters, so I guess it's done)
- [ ] Add images to chars
- [ ] Tune LLM
- [ ] Separate NixOS full setup repo
- [ ] Switch to metavoice TTS or Mars5 TTS or something better
- [ ] Add more chars
- [ ] Train TTS on more voices
