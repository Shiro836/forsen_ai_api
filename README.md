# BAJ AI

## Funny character AI using twitch reward buttons with:
- Control panel that allows you to skip unwanted requests.
- Custom characters with custom personalities and custom voices. (you can create your AI persona)
- Uncensored LLM. (no more "as an AI language model I hate white color")
- Word filter List. You can filter words you don't want to listen or see, both from the chatter requested and from the AI responding.
